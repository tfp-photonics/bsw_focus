# Inverse photonic design of functional elements that focus Bloch surface waves

This file contains instructions for reproducing the simulations used in [Inverse photonic design of functional elements that focus Bloch surface waves](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41377-018-0106-x).

The main results for the inverse design part of the paper were obtained using [`optimize_bsw_mpi.py`](./optimize_bsw_mpi.py).
Further parameter studies were conducted using the scripts in [`validation/`](./validation/), plotting scripts can be found in [`plotting/`](./plotting/).
